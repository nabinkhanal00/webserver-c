# Webserver In C
A simple library where you can write backend applications in c.

## Instructions
You can run the example application using:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/nabinkhanal00/webserver-c <your-application-name>
cd <your-application-name>
make server && ./bin/server
```

The example application is present in `<your-application-name>/server_test.c`.

You can now create your applications using same pattern.

## Incomplete

This project is still incomplete. It is created for learning.

Here are some things to do in no particular order:
- [ ] Parse URL and Query Params.
- [ ] Parse Form Data
- [ ] Support to Marshal and Unmarshal data
- [ ] any many more ...

I will add more tasks. 

You can **contribute** to the project by creating pull requests.
